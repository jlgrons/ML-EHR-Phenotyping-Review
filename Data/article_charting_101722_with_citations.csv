Acknowledging this, the Social Security Administration directs employees to prioritize homeless patients and handle their disability claims with special care. However, under existing manual processes for identification of homelessness, many homeless patients never receive the special service to which they are entitled. In this paper, we explore address validation and automatic annotation of electronic health records to improve identification of homeless patients.Materials and Methods: We developed a sample of claims containing medical records at the moment of arrival in a single office. Using address validation software, we reconciled patient addresses with public directories of homeless shelters, veterans' hospitals and clinics, and correctional facilities. Other tools annotated electronic health records. We trained random forests to identify homeless patients and validated each model with 10-fold cross validation.Results: For our finished model, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.942. The random forest improved sensitivity from 0.067 to 0.879 but decreased positive predictive value to 0.382.Discussion: Presumed false positive classifications bore many characteristics of homelessness. Organizations could use these methods to prompt early collection of information necessary to avoid labor-intensive attempts to reestablish contact with homeless individuals. Annually, such methods could benefit tens of thousands of patients who are homeless, destitute, and in urgent need of assistance.Conclusion: We were able to identify many more homeless patients through a combination of automatic address validation and natural language processing of unstructured electronic health records.",,1,,,NA,1,,,1,,,"This paper used NLP methods to annotate the claims data for the identification of homelessness, and then used SVM to construct prediction models",Homelessness,,,,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,Minnesota Disability Determination Services,0,,0,,Claims data,US,33420 disability claims,4628 claims,Claim notes,English,Demographics,,UMLS,Random forest,,,,,,Supervised,NLP mentions ,NLP mentions ,,,4166 patients,,462 patients,MetaMap; NegEx,,,,AUROC; Accuracy; Recall; Specificity; Precision; NPV,,Random forest,0.942,,0.382,0.879,0.987,0.871,,,,,,,NA,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,0,0,,,Application

With sufficient accuracy the model can be deployed as a first round screening tool for clinical follow-up including neurological examination, neuropsychological testing, imaging and recruitment to clinical trials. Seven cohorts with two years of data, three to eight years prior to index date, and an incident cohort were created. Four trained models for each cohort, boosted trees, feed forward network, recurrent neural network and recurrent neural network with pre-trained weights, were constructed and their performance compared using validation and test data. The incident model had an AUC of 94.4% and F1 score of 54.1%. Eight years removed from index date the AUC and F1 scores were 80.7% and 25.6%, respectively.

This project aimed to apply machine learning classification techniques to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a claims-based algorithm to predict an HOI in structured electronic health record (EHR) data.Materials and Methods: We used the 2015-2019 IBM MarketScan Explorys Claims-EMR Data Set, linking administrative claims and EHR data at the patient level. We focused on a single HOI, rhabdomyolysis, defined by EHR laboratory test results. Using claims-based predictors, we applied machine learning techniques to predict the HOI: logistic regression, LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), random forests, support vector machines, artificial neural nets, and an ensemble method (Super Learner).Results: The study cohort included 32 956 patients and 39 499 encounters.

We previously developed a model to predict EF class from Medicare claims. Here, we evaluated the performance of this model in an external validation sample of commercial insurance enrollees. Methods Truven MarketScan claims linked to electronic medical records (EMR) data (IBM Explorys) containing EF measurements were used to identify a cohort of US patients with HF between 01-01-2012 and 10-31-2019. By applying the previously developed model, patients were classified into HF with reduced EF (HFrEF) or preserved EF (HFpEF). EF values recorded in EMR data were used to define gold-standard HFpEF (LVEF ≥45%) and HFrEF (LVEF<45%). Model performance was reported in terms of overall accuracy, positive predicted values (PPV), and sensitivity for HFrEF and HFpEF. Results A total of 7,001 HF patients with an average age of 71 years were identified, 1,700 (24.3%) of whom had HFrEF. An overall accuracy of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.80–0.82) was seen in this external validation sample. For HFpEF, the model had sensitivity of 0.96 (95%CI, 0.95–0.97) and PPV of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.81–0.82); while for HFrEF, the sensitivity was 0.32 (95%CI, 0.30–0.34) and PPV was 0.73 (95%CI, 0.69–0.76). These results were consistent with what was previously published in US Medicare claims data.

However, SDOH are rarely available in structured electronic health record (EHR) data such as diagnosis codes, and more commonly found in unstructured narrative clinical notes. Hence, identifying social context from unstructured EHR data has become increasingly important. Yet, previous work on using natural language processing to automate extraction of SDOH from text (a) usually focuses on an ad hoc selection of SDOH, and (b) does not use the latest advances in deep learning. Our objective was to advance automatic extraction of SDOH from clinical text by (a) systematically creating a set of SDOH based on standard biomedical and psychiatric ontologies, and (b) training state-of-the-art deep neural networks to extract mentions of these SDOH from clinical notes.Design: A retrospective cohort study.Setting and participants: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database. The corpus comprised 3,504 social related sentences from 2,670 clinical notes.Methods: We developed a framework for automated classification of multiple SDOH categories. Our dataset comprised narrative clinical notes under the Social Work category in the MIMIC-III Clinical Database. Using standard terminologies, SNOMED-CT and DSM-IV, we systematically curated a set of 13 SDOH categories and created annotation guidelines for these. After manually annotating the 3,504 sentences, we developed and tested three deep neural network (DNN) architectures - convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) - for automated detection of eight SDOH categories. We also compared these DNNs to three baselines models: (1) cTAKES, as well as (2) L2-regularized logistic regression and (3) random forests on bags-of-words. Model evaluation metrics included micro- and macro- F1, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).Results: All three DNN models accurately classified all SDOH categories (minimum micro-F1 = 0.632, minimum macro-AUC = 0.854). Compared to the CNN and LSTM, BERT performed best in most key metrics (micro-F1 = 0.690, macro-AUC = 0.907). The BERT model most effectively identified the occupational category (F1 = 0.774, AUC = 0.965) and least effectively identified the non-SDOH category (F = 0.491, AUC = 0.788). BERT outperformed cTAKES in distinguishing social vs non-social sentences (BERT F1 = 0.87 vs. cTAKES F1 = 0.06), and outperformed logistic regression (micro-F1 = 0.649, macro-AUC = 0.696) and random forest (micro-F1 = 0.502, macro-AUC = 0.523) trained on bag-of-words.Conclusions: Our study framework with DNN models demonstrated improved performance for efficiently identifying a systematic range of SDOH categories from clinical notes in the EHR.

In 2017, child abuse was responsible for 1688 fatalities in the United States, of 3.5 million children referred to Child Protection Services and 674,000 substantiated victims. While large referral hospitals maintain teams trained in Child Abuse Pediatrics, smaller community hospitals often do not have such dedicated resources to evaluate patients for potential abuse. Moreover, identification of abuse has a low margin of error, as false positive identifications lead to unwarranted separations, while false negatives allow dangerous situations to continue. This context makes the consistent detection of and response to abuse difficult, particularly given subtle signs in young, non-verbal patients. Here, we describe the development of artificial intelligence algorithms that use unstructured free-text in the electronic medical record-including notes from physicians, nurses, and social workers-to identify children who are suspected victims of physical abuse. Importantly, only the notes from time of first encounter (e.g.: birth, routine visit, sickness) to the last record before child protection team involvement were used. This allowed us to develop an algorithm using only information available prior to referral to the specialized child protection team. The study was performed in a multi-center referral pediatric hospital on patients screened for abuse within five different locations between 2015 and 2019. Of 1123 patients, 867 records were available after data cleaning and processing, and 55% were abuse-positive as determined by a multi-disciplinary team of clinical professionals. These electronic medical records were encoded with three natural language processing (NLP) algorithms-Bag of Words (BOW), Word Embeddings (WE), and Rules-Based (RB)-and used to train multiple neural network architectures. The BOW and WE encodings utilize the full free-text, while RB selects crucial phrases as identified by physicians. The best architecture was selected by average classification accuracy for the best performing model from each train-test split of a cross-validation experiment. Natural language processing coupled with neural networks detected cases of likely child abuse using only information available to clinicians prior to child protection team referral with average accuracy of 0.90 +/- 0.02 and average area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) 0.93 +/- 0.02 for the best performing Bag of Words models. The best performing rules-based models achieved average accuracy of 0.77 +/- 0.04 and average ROCAUC 0.81 +/- 0.05, while a Word Embeddings strategy was severely limited by lack of representative embeddings. Importantly, the best performing model had a false positive rate of 8%, as compared to rates of 20% or higher in previously reported studies. This artificial intelligence approach can help screen patients for whom an abuse concern exists and streamline the identification of patients who may benefit from referral to a child protection team. Furthermore, this approach could be applied to develop computer-aided-diagnosis platforms for the challenging and often intractable problem of reliably identifying pediatric patients suffering from physical abuse.",,1,,,NA,1,,,1,,,"This paper used word embedding to represent text and classify patients with abuse, but rule-based achieved high accuracy and AUROC",Child physical abuse,,,Health and health care,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,1,A multi-center referral pediatric hospital; MIMIC-III database,1,,1,,,US,,1123 patients; 867 records,Radiology reports; Summaries of lab tests,English,,,,,FFNN,,,MLP,,Weakly-supervised,Keyword search,Chart review,Bag of words; TFIDF; GloVe,Wikipedia; MIMIC-III database (external),781 patients,,86 patients,,Transfer learning,,Logistic regression,Accuracy; AUROC; Specificity; Recall,DL,MLP,0.93,,,0.93,,0.86,,,,,,,NA,,,,,NA,NA,Logistic regression,0.88,,,0.92,NA,0.84,,,,,,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,0,0,,,Application

In many cases, the most valuable and relevant information for an accurate classification of medical conditions exist only in clinical narratives. Therefore, it is necessary to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract and evaluate these narratives. The most commonly used approach to this problem relies on extracting a number of clinician-defined medical concepts from text and using machine learning techniques to identify whether a particular patient has a certain condition. However, recent advances in deep learning and NLP enable models to learn a rich representation of (medical) language. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) for text classification can augment the existing techniques by leveraging the representation of language to learn which phrases in a text are relevant for a given medical condition. In this work, we compare concept extraction based methods with CNNs and other commonly used models in NLP in ten phenotyping tasks using 1,610 discharge summaries from the MIMIC-III database. We show that CNNs outperform concept extraction based methods in almost all of the tasks, with an improvement in F1-score of up to 26 and up to 7 percentage points in area under the ROC curve (AUC).

We investigate how to leverage clinical notes using novel applications of multi-label learning (MLL) to classify SDH in mental health and substance use disorder patients who frequent the emergency department.Methods and Materials: We labeled a gold-standard corpus of EHR clinical note sentences (N = 4063) with 6 identified SDH-related domains recommended by the Institute of Medicine for inclusion in the EHR. We then trained 5 classification models: linear-Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, XGBoost, and bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM). We adopted 5 common evaluation measures: accuracy, average precision-recall (AP), area under the curve receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC), Hamming loss, and log loss to compare the performance of different methods for MLL classification using the F1 score as the primary evaluation metric.Results: Our results suggested that, overall, BI-LSTM outperformed the other classification models in terms of AUC-ROC (93.9), AP (0.76), and Hamming loss (0.12). The AUC-ROC values of MLL models of SDH related domains varied between (0.59-1.0). We found that 44.6% of our study population (N = 1119) had at least one positive documentation of SDH.Discussion and Conclusion: The proposed approach of training an MLL model on an SDH rich data source can produce a high performing classifier using only unstructured clinical notes.

In clinical research studies, especially comparative effectiveness studies, failure to adjust for SBDoH factors will potentially cause confounding issues and misclassification errors in either statistical analyses and machine learning-based models. However, there are limited studies to examine SBDoH factors in clinical outcomes due to the lack of structured SBDoH information in current electronic health record (EHR) systems, while much of the SBDoH information is documented in clinical narratives. Natural language processing (NLP) is thus the key technology to extract such information from unstructured clinical text. However, there is not a mature clinical NLP system focusing on SBDoH. In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art transformer-based NLP models, including BERT and RoBERTa, to extract SBDoH concepts from clinical narratives, applied the best performing model to extract SBDoH concepts on a lung cancer screening patient cohort, and examined the difference of SBDoH information between NLP extracted results and structured EHRs (SBDoH information captured in standard vocabularies such as the International Classification of Diseases codes). The experimental results show that the BERT-based NLP model achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of 0.8791 and 0.8999, respectively. The comparison between NLP extracted SBDoH information and structured EHRs in the lung cancer patient cohort of 864 patients with 161,933 various types of clinical notes showed that much more detailed information about smoking, education, and employment were only captured in clinical narratives and that it is necessary to use both clinical narratives and structured EHRs to construct a more complete picture of patients' SBDoH factors.",,1,,,1,1,,,1,,,This paper used DL to identify social determinants of health from structured and unstructured EHR,Gender; Ethnicity; Smoking; Employment; Education,,,Social and community context; Social and community context; Health and health care; Economic stability; Education,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,5,University of Florida; MIMIC-III database,1,,1,,,US,,20000 patients; 1.5 million clinical notes,Clinical notes,English,Demographics; Encounters,,,,BERT,,,,BERT; RoBERTa,Supervised,Chart review,Chart review,BERT; RoBERTa,MIMIC-III database (external),400 notes,,100 notes,,Transfer learning,,,Precision; Recall; F-score,,BERT,,0.899,0.9058,0.941,,,,,,,,,NA,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,0,0,,,Application

In this study, we automatically identify vulnerable older adult patients with geriatric syndrome based on clinical notes extracted from an EHR system, and demonstrate how contextual information can improve the process.Materials and Methods: We propose a novel end-to-end neural architecture to identify sentences that contain geriatric syndromes. Our model learns a representation of the sentence and augments it with contextual information: surrounding sentences, the entire clinical document, and the diagnosis codes associated with the document. We trained our system on annotated notes from 85 patients, tuned the model on another 50 patients, and evaluated its performance on the rest, 50 patients.Results: Contextual information improved classification, with the most effective context coming from the surrounding sentences.

Co-occurring conditions are especially prevalent among individuals suffering from kidney disease, an increasingly widespread condition affecting 13% of the general population in the US.

Specifically, we apply topic modeling in a non-traditional way to find associations across SNOMED-CT codes assigned and recorded in the EHRs of > 13,000 patients diagnosed with kidney disease. Unlike most prior work on topic modeling, we apply the method to codes rather than to natural language. Moreover, we quantitatively evaluate the topics, assessing their tightness and distinctiveness, and also assess the medical validity of our results. Our experiments show that each topic is succinctly characterized by a few highly probable and unique disease codes, indicating that the topics are tight. Furthermore, inter-topic distance between each pair of topics is typically high, illustrating distinctiveness.

We annotated 1000 notes for use as training and testing data and determined how well 3 pretrained neural models, BERT, RoBERTa, and Bio_ClinicalBERT, could identify and extract the desired information after finetuning. Results The finetuned models (BERTFT, Bio_ClinicalBERT(FT), and RoBERTa(FT)) achieved near-human performance when classifying patients as seizure free, with BERTFT and Bio_ClinicalBERT(FT) achieving accuracy scores over 80%.

This effort was part of the 2018 n2c2 shared task on adverse drug events and medication extraction.Materials and Methods: The new NLP system implements a stacked generalization based on a search-based structured prediction algorithm for concept extraction. We trained 4 sequential classifiers using a variety of structured learning algorithms. To enhance accuracy, we created a stacked ensemble consisting of these concept extraction models trained on the shared task training data. We implemented a support vector machine model to identify related concepts.Results: Experiments with the official test set showed that our stacked ensemble achieved an F1 score of 92.66%. The relation extraction model with given concepts reached a 93.59% F1 score. Our end-to-end system yielded overall micro-averaged recall, precision, and F1 score of 92.52%, 81.88% and 86.88%, respectively. Our NLP system for adverse drug events and medication extraction ranked within the top 5 of teams participating in the challenge.Conclusion: This study demonstrated that a stacked ensemble with a search-based structured prediction algorithm achieved good performance by effectively integrating the output of individual classifiers and could provide a valid solution for other clinical concept extraction tasks.",Ensemble,1,,,NA,1,,,1,,,This paper used DL to identify ADE that outperforms ML in terms of recall and F1 score.,Adverse drug event,,,,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,MIMIC-III database,0,i2b2,1,2018 n2c2 track 2,CSIRO Adverse Drug Events Corpus; MedEx; CADEC; 2009 i2b2 challenge; 2010 i2b2 challenge,US,,505 discharge notes,Discharge summaries,English,,,,,RNN,,Bi-LSTM,,,Supervised,Chart review,Chart review,GloVe,Wikipedia,303 notes,,202 notes,Stanford CoreNLP,Transfer learning,,CRF,F-score; Precision; Recall,DL,Ensemble method,,0.9266,0.963,0.8929,,,,,,,,,NA,Bi-LSTM,,0.9215,0.9465,0.8978,NA,CRF,,0.9197,0.9571,0.8852,NA,NA,,,,,,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,0,0,,,Application

Extracting ADEs from clinical records can help physicians associate adverse events to targeted drugs.Materials and Methods: We proposed a cascading architecture to recognize medical concepts including ADEs, drug names, and entities related to drugs. The architecture includes a preprocessing method and an ensemble of conditional random fields (CRFs) and neural network-based models to respectively address the challenges of surrogate string and overlapping annotation boundaries observed in the employed ADEs and medication extraction (ADME) corpus. The effectiveness of applying different pretrained and postprocessed word embeddings for the ADME task was also studied.Results: The empirical results showed that both CRFs and neural network-based models provide promising solution for the ADME task. The neural network-based models particularly outperformed CRFs in concept types involving narrative descriptions. Our best run achieved an overall micro F-score of 0.919 on the employed corpus.

Rare diseases are often not diagnosed or delayed in diagnosis by clinicians who encounter them infrequently. One such rare disease that may be amenable to EHR-based detection is acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). AHP consists of a family of rare, metabolic diseases characterized by potentially life-threatening acute attacks and chronic debilitating symptoms. The goal of this study was to apply machine learning and knowledge engineering to a large extract of EHR data to determine whether they could be effective in identifying patients not previously tested for AHP who should receive a proper diagnostic workup for AHP. Methods and findings We used an extract of the complete EHR data of 200,000 patients from an academic medical center and enriched it with records from an additional 5,571 patients containing any mention of porphyria in the record. After manually reviewing the records of all 47 unique patients with the ICD-10-CM code E80.21 (Acute intermittent [hepatic] porphyria), we identified 30 patients who were positive cases for our machine learning models, with the rest of the patients used as negative cases. We parsed the record into features, which were scored by frequency of appearance and filtered using univariate feature analysis. We manually choose features not directly tied to provider attributes or suspicion of the patient having AHP. We trained on the full dataset, with the best cross-validation performance coming from support vector machine (SVM) algorithm using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. The trained model was applied back to the full data set and patients were ranked by margin distance. The top 100 ranked negative cases were manually reviewed for symptom complexes similar to AHP, finding four patients where AHP diagnostic testing was likely indicated and 18 patients where AHP diagnostic testing was possibly indicated. From the top 100 ranked cases of patients with mention of porphyria in their record, we identified four patients for whom AHP diagnostic testing was possibly indicated and had not been previously performed. Based solely on the reported prevalence of AHP, we would have expected only 0.002 cases out of the 200 patients manually reviewed. Conclusions The application of machine learning and knowledge engineering to EHR data may facilitate the diagnosis of rare diseases such as AHP. Further work will recommend clinical investigation to identified patients' clinicians, evaluate more patients, assess additional feature selection and machine learning algorithms, and apply this methodology to other rare diseases. This work provides strong evidence that population-level informatics can be applied to rare diseases, greatly improving our ability to identify undiagnosed patients, and in the future improve the care of these patients and our ability study these diseases. The next step is to learn how best to apply these EHR-based machine learning approaches to benefit individual patients with a clinical study that provides diagnostic testing and clinical follow up for those identified as possibly having undiagnosed AHP.",,1,,,NA,1,,,1,,,"This paper focused on a rare phenotype, the acute hepatic porphyria and used SVM to predict it.

We compared PheMap to clinician-validated phenotyping algorithms from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), dementia, and hypothyroidism using 84 821 individuals from Vanderbilt Univeresity Medical Center's BioVU DNA Biobank. We implemented PheMap-based phenotypes for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for T2DM, dementia, and hypothyroidism, and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) for variants in FTO, HLA-DRB1, and TCF7L2.Results: In this initial iteration, the PheMap knowledge base contains quantified concepts for 841 disease phenotypes. For T2DM, dementia, and hypothyroidism, the accuracy of the PheMap phenotypes were >97% using a 50% threshold and eMERGE case-control status as a reference standard. In the GWAS analyses, Phe-Mapderived phenotype probabilities replicated 43 of 51 previously reported disease-associated variants for the 3 phenotypes. For 9 of the 11 top associations, PheMap provided an equivalent or more significant P value than eMERGE-based phenotypes. The PheMap-based PheWAS showed comparable or better performance to a traditional phecode-based PheWAS.

However, the variation in the accuracy of diagnosis codes can impair the power of such screens. Our objective was to develop and evaluate an approach which converts diagnosis codes into a probability of a phenotype (PheProb). We hypothesized that this alternate approach for defining phenotypes would improve power for genetic association studies.Methods: The PheProb approach employs unsupervised clustering to separate patients into 2 groups based on diagnosis codes. Subjects are assigned a probability of having the phenotype based on the number of diagnosis codes. This approach was developed using simulated EHR data and tested in a real world EHR cohort. In the latter, we tested the association between low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) genetic risk alleles known for association with hyperlipidemia and hyperlipidemia codes (ICD-9 272.x). PheProb and thresholding approaches were compared.Results: Among n = 1462 subjects in the real world EHR cohort, the threshold-based p-values for association between the genetic risk score (GRS) and hyperlipidemia were 0.126 (>= 1 code), 0.123 (>= 2 codes), and 0.142 (>= 3 codes). The PheProb approach produced the expected significant association between the GRS and hyperlipidemia: p = .001.Conclusions: PheProb improves statistical power for association studies relative to standard thresholding approaches by leveraging information about the phenotype in the billing code counts.

Chart review as well as rule-based and supervised phenotyping approaches require laborious expert input, hampering applicability to studies that require many phenotypes to be defined and labeled de novo. Though International Classification of Diseases codes are often used as surrogates for true labels in this setting, these sometimes suffer from poor specificity. We propose a fully automated topic modeling algorithm to simultaneously annotate multiple phenotypes.Materials and Methods: Surrogate-guided ensemble latent Dirichlet allocation (sureLDA) is a label-free multidimensional phenotyping method. It first uses the PheNorm algorithm to initialize probabilities based on 2 surrogate features for each target phenotype, and then leverages these probabilities to constrain the LDA topic model to generate phenotype-specific topics. Finally, it combines phenotype-feature counts with surrogates via clustering ensemble to yield final phenotype probabilities.Results: sureLDA achieves reliably high accuracy and precision across a range of simulated and real-world phenotypes. Its performance is robust to phenotype prevalence and relative informativeness of surogate vs nonsurrogate features. It also exhibits powerful feature selection properties.Discussion: sureLDA combines attractive properties of PheNorm and LDA to achieve high accuracy and precision robust to diverse phenotype characteristics. It offers particular improvement for phenotypes insufficiently captured by a few surrogate features. Moreover, sureLDA's feature selection ability enables it to handle high feature dimensions and produce interpretable computational phenotypes.Conclusions: sureLDA is well suited toward large-scale electronic health record phenotyping for highly multiphenotype applications such as phenome-wide association studies.",,1,,,NA,1,,,1,,,"This paper developed a WSL sureLDA method that used PheNorm scores as the initial probabilities to the LDA parameters, then used the Gaussian mixture regression on LDA features to yield final phenotype probabilities.

To further accelerate the development of phenotyping algorithms, we propose a fully automated and robust unsupervised feature selection method that leverages only publicly available medical knowledge sources, instead of EHR data.Methods: SEmantics-Driven Feature Extraction (SEDFE) collects medical concepts from online knowledge sources as candidate features and gives them vector-form distributional semantic representations derived with neural word embedding and the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus. A number of features that are semantically closest and that sufficiently characterize the target phenotype are determined by a linear decomposition criterion and are selected for the final classification algorithm.Results: SEDFE was compared with the EHR-based SAFE algorithm and domain experts on feature selection for the classification of five phenotypes including coronary artery disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension using both supervised and unsupervised approaches. Algorithms yielded by SEDFE achieved comparable accuracy to those yielded by SAFE and expertcurated features.

Recent advances in unsupervised machine learning on electronic health record (EHR) data have enabled researchers to discover phenotypes without input from domain experts. However, most existing studies have ignored time and modeled diseases as discrete events. Uncovering the evolution of phenotypes - how they emerge, evolve and contribute to health outcomes - is essential to define more precise phenotypes and refine the understanding of disease progression. Our objective was to assess the benefits of an unsupervised approach that incorporates time to model diseases as dynamic processes in phenotype discovery.Methods: In this study, we applied a constrained non-negative tensor-factorization approach to characterize the complexity of cardiovascular disease (CVD) patient cohort based on longitudinal EHR data. Through tensorfactorization, we identified a set of phenotypic topics (i.e., subphenotypes) that these patients established over the 10 years prior to the diagnosis of CVD, and showed the progress pattern. For each identified subphenotype, we examined its association with the risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes estimated by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Pooled Cohort Risk Equations, a conventional CVD-risk assessment tool frequently used in clinical practice. Furthermore, we compared the subsequent myocardial infarction (MI) rates among the six most prevalent subphenotypes using survival analysis.Results: From a cohort of 12,380 adult CVD individuals with 1068 unique PheCodes, we successfully identified 14 subphenotypes. Through the association analysis with estimated CVD risk for each subtype, we found some phenotypic topics such as Vitamin D deficiency and depression, Urinary infections cannot be explained by the conventional risk factors. Through a survival analysis, we found markedly different risks of subsequent MI following the diagnosis of CVD among the six most prevalent topics (p < 0.0001), indicating these topics may capture clinically meaningful subphenotypes of CVD.Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential benefits of using tensor-decomposition to model diseases as dynamic processes from longitudinal EHR data.

A prognostic enrichment strategy with latent class analysis (LCA) may facilitate treatment strategies in subtypes of opioid misuse. We aim to identify subtypes of patients with opioid misuse and examine the distinctions between the subtypes by examining patient characteristics, topic models from clinical notes, and clinical outcomes.MethodsThis was an observational study of inpatient hospitalizations at a tertiary care center between 2007 and 2017. Patients with opioid misuse were identified using an operational definition applied to all inpatient encounters. LCA with eight class-defining variables from the electronic health record (EHR) was applied to identify subtypes in the cohort of patients with opioid misuse. Comparisons between subtypes were made using the following approaches: (1) descriptive statistics on patient characteristics and healthcare utilization using EHR data and census-level data; (2) topic models with natural language processing (NLP) from clinical notes; (3) association with hospital outcomes.FindingsThe analysis cohort was 6,224 (2.7% of all hospitalizations) patient encounters with opioid misuse with a data corpus of 422,147 clinical notes. LCA identified four subtypes with differing patient characteristics, topics from the clinical notes, and hospital outcomes. Class 1 was categorized by high hospital utilization with known opioid-related conditions (36.5%); Class 2 included patients with illicit use, low socioeconomic status, and psychoses (12.8%); Class 3 contained patients with alcohol use disorders with complications (39.2%); and class 4 consisted of those with low hospital utilization and incidental opioid misuse (11.5%). The following hospital outcomes were the highest for each subtype when compared against the other subtypes: readmission for class 1 (13.9% vs. 10.5%, p<0.01); discharge against medical advice for class 2 (12.3% vs. 5.3%, p<0.01); and in-hospital death for classes 3 and 4 (3.2% vs. 1.9%, p<0.01).ConclusionsA 4-class latent model was the most parsimonious model that defined clinically interpretable and relevant subtypes for opioid misuse.

Unsupervised machine learning, as opposed to supervised learning, has shown promise in identifying novel patterns and relations from EHRs without using human created labels. In this paper, we investigate the application of unsupervised machine learning models in discovering latent disease clusters and patient subgroups based on EHRs. We utilized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model, and proposed a novel model named Poisson Dirichlet Model (PDM), which extends the LDA approach using a Poisson distribution to model patients' disease diagnoses and to alleviate age and sex factors by considering both observed and expected observations. In the empirical experiments, we evaluated LDA and PDM on three patient cohorts, namely Osteoporosis, Delirium/Dementia, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)/Bronchiectasis Cohorts, with their EHR data retrieved from the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) medical records linkage system, for the discovery of latent disease clusters and patient subgroups. We compared the effectiveness of LDA and PDM in identifying disease clusters through the visualization of disease representations. We tested the performance of LDA and PDM in differentiating patient subgroups through survival analysis, as well as statistical analysis of demographics and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) scores in those subgroups. The experimental results show that the proposed PDM could effectively identify distinguished disease clusters based on the latent patterns hidden in the EHR data by alleviating the impact of age and sex, and that LDA could stratify patients into differentiable subgroups with larger p-values than PDM. However, those subgroups identified by LDA are highly associated with patients' age and sex. The subgroups discovered by PDM might imply the underlying patterns of diseases of greater interest in epidemiology research due to the alleviation of age and sex.

Detecting phenotypic relevance is an important task when translating precision medicine into clinical practice, especially for patient stratification tasks based on deep phenotyping. In our previous work, we developed node embeddings for the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) to assist in phenotypic relevance measurement incorporating distributed semantic representations. However, the derived HPO embeddings hold only distributed representations for IS-A relationships among nodes, hampering the ability to fully explore the graph.Methods: In this study, we developed a framework, HPO2Vec +, to enrich the produced HPO embeddings with heterogeneous knowledge resources (i.e., DECIPHER, OMIM, and Orphanet) for detecting phenotypic relevance. Specifically, we parsed disease-phenotype associations contained in these three resources to enrich non-inheritance relationships among phenotypic nodes in the HPO. To generate node embeddings for the HPO, no-de2vec was applied to perform node sampling on the enriched HPO graphs based on random walk followed by feature learning over the sampled nodes to generate enriched node embeddings. Four HPO embeddings were generated based on different graph structures, which we hereafter label as HPOEmb-Original, HPOEmb-DECIPHER, HPOEmb-OMIM, and HPOEmb-Orphanet. We evaluated the derived embeddings quantitatively through an HPO link prediction task with four edge embeddings operations and six machine learning algorithms. The resulting best embeddings were then evaluated for patient stratification of 10 rare diseases using electronic health records (EHR) collected at Mayo Clinic. We assessed our framework qualitatively by visualizing phenotypic clusters and conducting a use case study on primary hyperoxaluria (PH), a rare disease, on the task of inferring relevant phenotypes given 22 annotated PH related phenotypes.Results: The quantitative link prediction task shows that HPOEmb-Orphanet achieved an optimal AUROC of 0.92 and an average precision of 0.94. In addition, HPOEmb-Orphanet achieved an optimal F1 score of 0.86. The quantitative patient similarity measurement task indicates that HPOEmb-Orphanet achieved the highest average detection rate for similar patients over 10 rare diseases and performed better than other similarity measures implemented by an existing tool, HPOSim, especially for pairwise patients with fewer shared common phenotypes. The qualitative evaluation shows that the enriched HPO embeddings are generally able to detect relationships among nodes with fine granularity and HPOEmb-Orphanet is particularly good at associating phenotypes across different disease systems. For the use case of detecting relevant phenotypic characterizations for given PH related phenotypes, HPOEmb-Orphanet outperformed the other three HPO embeddings by achieving the highest average P@5 of 0.81 and the highest P@10 of 0.79. Compared to seven conventional similarity measurements provided by HPOSim, HPOEmb-Orphanet is able to detect more relevant phenotypic pairs, especially for pairs not in inheritance relationships.Conclusion: We drew the following conclusions based on the evaluation results. First, with additional non-inheritance edges, enriched HPO embeddings can detect more associations between fine granularity phenotypic nodes regardless of their topological structures in the HPO graph. Second, HPOEmb-Orphanet not only can achieve the optimal performance through link prediction and patient stratification based on phenotypic similarity, but is also able to detect relevant phenotypes closer to domain expert's judgments than other embeddings and conventional similarity measurements. Third, incorporating heterogeneous knowledge resources do not necessarily result in better performance for detecting relevant phenotypes. From a clinical perspective, in our use case study, clinical-oriented knowledge resources (e.g., Orphanet) can achieve better performance in detecting relevant phenotypic characterizations compared to biomedical-oriented knowledge resources (e.g., DECIPHER and OMIM).",,1,,,NA,1,,,1,,,"This paper used embeddings and calculate patient similarity scores using the embeddings for 10 rare disease, then investigate whether the similarity scores can be used to infer a rare disease PH  The embeddings are trained unsupervised, and the inferring/score calculating is based on the rules.

Past studies investigating these relationships have used longitudinal cohort data collected over the course of many years to investigate the connection between BMI trajectory and subsequent development of diabetes. In contrast, EHR data from routine clinical care can provide longitudinal information on early-life BMI trajectories as well as subsequent health outcomes without requiring any additional data collection. In this study, we introduce a Bayesian joint phenotyping and BMI trajectory model to address data quality challenges in an EHR-based study of early-life BMI and type 2 diabetes in adolescence. We compared this joint modeling approach to traditional approaches using a computable phenotype for type 2 diabetes or separately estimated BMI trajectories and type 2 diabetes phenotypes. In a sample of 49,062 children derived from the PEDSnet consortium of pediatric healthcare systems, a median 8 (interquartile range [IQR] 5-13) BMI measurements were available to characterize the early-life BMI trajectory.

Materials and Methods: The study employs a retrospective open cohort design, consisting of 382,666 primary care progress notes from 44,828 patients, 54 physicians, and 12 clinics collected 01/01/2017 through 31/12/2020. Non-negative matrix factorization uncovers a meaningful latent topical structure permeating the corpus of primary care notes. The learned latent topical basis is transformed into a multivariate time series data structure. Time series methods and plots showcase the evolution/dynamics of learned topics over the study period and allow the identification of COVID-19 pandemic effects. We perform several post-hoc checks of model robustness to increase trust that descriptive/unsupervised inferences are stable over hyper-parameter configurations and/or data perturbations. Results: Temporal topic modelling uncovers a myriad of pandemic-related effects from the expressive clinical text data. In terms of direct effects on patient-health, topics encoding respiratory disease symptoms display altered dynamics during the pandemic year. Further, the pandemic was associated with a multitude of indirect patient level effects on topical domains representing mental health, sleep, social and familial dynamics, measurement of vitals/labs, uptake of prevention/screening maneuvers, and referrals to medical specialists. Finally, topic models capture changes in primary care practice patterns resulting from the pandemic, including changes in EMR documentation strategies and the uptake of telemedicine. Conclusion: Temporal topic modelling applied to a large corpus of rich primary care clinical text data, can identify a meaningful topical/thematic summarization which can provide policymakers and public health stakeholders a passive, cost-effective, technology for understanding holistic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the primary healthcare system and community/public-health.",,1,,,1,1,,,1,,,This paper used matrix factorization on COVID-19 patients to examine the pandemic effects,COVID-19 ,Disease progression,Disease progression/trajectory,,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,1,1,University of Toronto Practice Based Research Network (UTOPIAN),0,UTOPIAN,0,,,Canada,90000 patients,382666 notes,Clinical notes,English,,,,Non-negative matrix factorization,,,,,,Unsupervised,,,,,38266 notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NA,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,0,0,,,Application

We sought to develop and validate a computable phenotype for COVID-19 severity.Materials and Methods: Twelve 4CE sites participated. First, we developed an EHR-based severity phenotype consisting of 6 code classes, and we validated it on patient hospitalization data from the 12 4CE clinical sites against the outcomes of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or death. We also piloted an alternative machine learning approach and compared selected predictors of severity with the 4CE phenotype at 1 site.Results: The full 4CE severity phenotype had pooled sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity 0.83 for the combined outcome of ICU admission and/or death. The sensitivity of individual code categories for acuity had high variability-up to 0.65 across sites. At one pilot site, the expert-derived phenotype had mean area under the curve of 0.903 (95% confidence interval, 0.886-0.921), compared with an area under the curve of 0.956 (95% confidence interval, 0.952-0.959) for the machine learning approach.

HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is an emerging clinical data standard for exchanging electronic healthcare data and has been used in modeling and integrating both structured and unstructured EHR data for a variety of clinical research applications. The overall objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a FHIR-based EHR phenotyping framework for identification of patients with obesity and its multiple comorbidities from semi-structured discharge summaries leveraging a FHIR-based clinical data normalization pipeline (known as NLP2FHIR).Methods: We implemented a multi-class and multi-label classification system based on the i2b2 Obesity Challenge task to evaluate the FHIR-based EHR phenotyping framework. Two core parts of the framework are: (a) the conversion of discharge summaries into corresponding FHIR resources - Composition, Condition, MedicationStatement, Procedure and FamilyMemberHistory using the NLP2FHIR pipeline, and (b) the implementation of four machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest) to train classifiers to predict disease state of obesity and 15 comorbidities using features extracted from standard FHIR resources and terminology expansions. We used the macro- and micro-averaged precision (P), recall (R), and F1 score (Fl) measures to evaluate the classifier performance. We validated the framework using a second obesity dataset extracted from the MIMIC-III database.Results: Using the NLP2FHIR pipeline, 1237 clinical discharge summaries from the 2008 i2b2 obesity challenge dataset were represented as the instances of the FHIR Composition resource consisting of 5677 records with 16 unique section types. After the NLP processing and FHIR modeling, a set of 244,438 FHIR clinical resource instances were generated. As the results of the four machine learning classifiers, the random forest algorithm performed the best with Fl-micro(0.9466)/F1-macro(0.7887) and Fl-micro(0.9536)/F1-macro(0.6524) for intuitive classification (reflecting medical professionals' judgments) and textual classification (reflecting the judgments based on explicitly reported information of diseases), respectively.

In this study, we are concemed with the problem of AME detection by utilizing a large volume of unstructured EHR data. To address this challenge, we propose a neural attention network-based model to incorporate the contextual information of words into AME detection. Specifically, we develop a context-aware attention mechanism to locate salient words with respect to the target AMEs in patient medical records. And then we combine the proposed context attention mechanism with the deep learning tactic to boost the performance of AME detection.

To assist in this research effort, we developed a novel clinical data representation model entitled medical knowledge-infused convolutional neural network (MKCNN), which is used for learning the clinical trial criteria eligibility status of patients to participate in cohort studies.Materials and Methods: In this study, we propose a clinical text representation infused with medical knowledge (MK). First, we isolate the noise from the relevant data using a medically relevant description extractor; then we utilize log-likelihood ratio based weights from selected sentences to highlight met and not-met knowledge-infused representations in bichannel setting for each instance. The combined medical knowledge-infused representation (MK) from these modules helps identify significant clinical criteria semantics, which in turn renders effective learning when used with a convolutional neural network architecture.Results: MKCNN outperforms other Medical Knowledge (MK) relevant learning architectures by approximately 3%; notably SVM and XGBoost implementations developed in this study. MKCNN scored 86.1% on F1metric, a gain of 6% above the average performance assessed from the submissions for n2c2 task. Although pattern/rule-based methods show a higher average performance for the n2c2 clinical data set, MKCNN significantly improves performance of machine learning implementations for clinical datasets.Conclusion: MKCNN scored 86.1% on the F1 score metric.

Epidemiological studies about anaphylaxis are very important in planning and evaluating new strategies that prevent this reaction, but also in providing a guide to the treatment of patients who have just suffered an anaphylactic reaction. Electronic Medical Records (EMR) are one of the most effective and richest sources for the epidemiology of anaphylaxis, because they provide a low-cost way of accessing rich longitudinal data on large populations. However, a negative aspect is that researchers have to manually review a huge amount of information, which is a very costly and highly time consuming task. Therefore, our goal is to explore different machine learning techniques to process Big Data EMR, lessening the needed efforts for performing epidemiological studies about anaphylaxis. In particular, we aim to study the incidence of anaphylaxis by the automatic classification of EMR. To do this, we employ the most widely used and efficient classifiers in text classification and compare different document representations, which range from well-known methods such as Bag Of Words (BoW) to more recent ones based on word embedding models, such as a simple average of word embeddings or a bag of centroids of word embeddings. Because the identification of anaphylaxis cases in EMR is a class-imbalanced problem (less than 1% describe anaphylaxis cases), we employ a novel undersampling technique based on clustering to balance our dataset. In addition to classical machine learning algorithms, we also use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify our dataset. In general, experiments show that the most classifiers and representations are effective (F1 above 90%).
